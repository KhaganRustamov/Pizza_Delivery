This is my first project using Typescript and Redux Toolkit, before this project I only used React. This is a pizzeria store where you can store up to 20 pizzas of different sizes and types, and depending on the selected types and sizes, the price of the pizza itself changes. Also here you can select pizzas by category, sort them and find the pizza you need. There is also page numbering, and most importantly - a cart into which you can easily add pizzas, and in the cart itself their number can be increased, decreased, removed from the cart, you can also “buy” pizzas in the cart, for this a popup with a form has been created, which sends a request to the server. This project uses technologies like React, Redux Toolkit, Typescript, SCSS and many other libraries like Axios, Debounce, Formik, Redux-persist, etc.
