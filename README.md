This is my first project using Typescript and Redux Toolkit, before this project I only used React. This is a pizza store where you can stock up to 20 pizzas, of different sizes and types, and depending on the selected types and sizes, the price of the pizza itself changes. Also here you can select pizzas by category, sort them, and search for the pizza you need. There is also pagination, and most importantly, a cart into which pizzas can be easily added, and in the cart itself you can increase, decrease their count and remove them from the cart. This project uses technologies such as React, Redux Toolkit, Typescript, SCSS, and many other libraries such as Axios, Debounce, etc.
